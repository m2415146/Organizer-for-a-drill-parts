# Organizer-for-a-drill-parts
This is a training task for making an organizer for a drill parts  

**i need to make an organizer for a parts like this**

## Intro

**Parameters:**   
numbers of parts - 15-20;  
one size from one point and different one from other;  

**Highly recommended:**  
combine these materials - plywood 3mm thiсkness, acrylic, polycarbonate, 3d printing materials - FFF (PLA, PETg)

## Overall  
Its a good idea to use the principle of "putting it in the hole" - its better than my idea of "use as attachments" drill parts, because of less material and easier to make it. Also its a good idea to add a 
drawer for additional parts. I want to think about how to make a acrylic/polycarbonate cap for it: for this moment i dont know how to make it with round angles for better view. I have an idea to use a 3d printed bearing to make a movable holder, but with limitations of time much effective to realize it in next projects in my opinion.
Also: for structural parts i prefer to use a PETg filament (better than PLA because of hydrolytic degradation can break it through 1+ year), holder will be in the box and if it brokes (box) - major to use it by itself. I dont like how to looks plywood but I'll think about how to use it: as a holder (because its faster than i can print it) or for the perimeter of the box

## 3d Modelling box for other things  
The harderst part for me. I spent half a day for it

Create a box and a printed cap with attachments to holder

Holes have been added because of less material, weight and some less time of printing, design also. later, during slicing, it became obvious that it made sense only for the sake of design - for example, the time gain was only 4 minutes. The most difficult stages of the simulation were the matching of the parts with each other. the desire to make the box collapsible lost out to my desire to go to bed, so I tried to print the whole box. To adapt to printing, I also modeled drawer guides with theoretically acceptable overhangs for printing
