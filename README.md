## Intro

**Parameters:**   
numbers of parts - 15-20;  
one size from one point and different one from other;  

**Highly recommended:**  
combine these materials - plywood 3mm thiсkness, acrylic, polycarbonate, 3d printing materials - FFF (PLA, PETg)

## Overall  
Its a good idea to use the principle of "putting it in the hole" - its better than my idea of "use as attachments" drill parts, because of less material and easier to make it. Also its a good idea to add a 
drawer for additional parts. I want to think about how to make a acrylic/polycarbonate cap for it: for this moment i dont know how to make it with round angles for better view. I have an idea to use a 3d printed bearing to make a movable holder, but with limitations of time much effective to realize it in next projects in my opinion.
Also: for structural parts i prefer to use a PETg filament (better than PLA because of hydrolytic degradation can break it through 1+ year), holder will be in the box and if it brokes (box) - major to use it by itself. I dont like how to looks plywood but I'll think about how to use it: as a holder (because its faster than i can print it) or for the perimeter of the box

## 3d Modelling box for other things  
The harderst part for me. I spent half a day for it

Holes have been added because of less material, weight and some less time of printing, design also. later, during slicing, it became obvious that it made sense only for the sake of design - for example, the time gain was only 4 minutes. The most difficult stages of the simulation were the matching of the parts with each other. the desire to make the box collapsible lost out to my desire to go to bed, so I tried to print the whole box. To adapt to printing, I also modeled drawer guides with theoretically acceptable overhangs for printing

## Problems

There is problem with box:  
![photo_5323817246105135485_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec58a2af-4326-450c-b097-be0891160b96)  



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c6e3d64-1ee0-49c6-86d6-83343827146b


Why did this happen?  

Overhangs? Orcaslicer said about it  
![Screenshot_130](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/977d06d8-5b4d-4f99-8d8c-40fe494e5bf3)  

- No, because we have the same part printed on the other side and we have modified the model to better print overhangs.
  
Cooling?
- No, because not the whole part is in the strings
  
For sure problems in model. We can see this in Orcaslicer
![Screenshot_131](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9adb213-af3d-4811-823e-9eafd7db8a38)

But in Rhino its not easy to see it

## Problem solving  

i thought about different varients to solve this. Major point - try to avoid reprinting the box. For sure if you do this project for the first time you must avoid this problem and use correct model.   

   1. Measurement different thickness of defected wall to find the difference
   ![photo_5326069045918820083_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b0c3357-9dc2-48a1-84e4-43129ce88c72)


By chance, we managed to conduct a test for falling from a height of 1.5 meters onto a tile

   3. Model a path for wall (i will print it if after the drawer test, this will be necessary)

## Modelling drawer  

So many time i've spent to engage the pull-out mechanism...  
It was also important not to increase its thickness excessively in order to save material and save free space. I had to abandon the previous complex rail system and integrate a system consisting of a small touch point in 2 planes on each side, also created cutouts in the box for the protruding parts of the former part of the box. I'll make it easier next time.  The holes are made to reduce printing time, save material and reduce the weight of the box itself in order to reduce the load on the sliding elements of the box and the box itself  

![Screenshot_144](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39be8336-1131-4239-9e23-afd632a234a4)  

Unfortunately, this method led to the appearance of overhanging elements that would require either support during 3D printing and subsequent post-processing, as well as could worsen the sliding of the drawer. I managed to adapt the internal cavities for the rails to 3D printing, there is no upper sliding part, so with a heavy heart I decided to divide the model into 2 parts and glue it later. if it does not withstand the load, I have hope that the box will still function

**Problems**  

PETg comes off the table, despite the fact that I use a lot of glue. I also noticed that the box itself is also deformed at the corners, especially on the side where the printing was unsuccessful due to a defect in the model - I probably should think about uniform cooling during printing or better isolate the printer from ventilation with an open window. But may be this is a reason why it works together (box and drawer) - because both are deformed. So, this is not a bug, but a feature

Creating a path to repair a box  
when I saw that the box was working, I decided that instead of the upper part of the drawer mount, it was worth printing the missing part of the inner wall of the box with a rail  

![Screenshot_150](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0119ae14-2659-402b-9003-a9d5c31e96df)  

but when I loaded the model into the slicer, I saw the overhanging elements and changed it so that it was adapted to 3D printing
