## Intro

**Parameters:**   
numbers of parts - 15-20;  
one size from one point and different one from other;  

**Highly recommended:**  
combine these materials - plywood 3mm thiсkness, acrylic, polycarbonate, 3d printing materials - FFF (PLA, PETg)

## Overall  
Its a good idea to use the principle of "putting it in the hole" - its better than my idea of "use as attachments" drill parts, because of less material and easier to make it. Also its a good idea to add a 
drawer for additional parts. I want to think about how to make a acrylic/polycarbonate cap for it: for this moment i dont know how to make it with round angles for better view. I have an idea to use a 3d printed bearing to make a movable holder, but with limitations of time much effective to realize it in next projects in my opinion.
Also: for structural parts i prefer to use a PETg filament (better than PLA because of hydrolytic degradation can break it through 1+ year), holder will be in the box and if it brokes (box) - major to use it by itself. I dont like how to looks plywood but I'll think about how to use it: as a holder (because its faster than i can print it) or for the perimeter of the box
