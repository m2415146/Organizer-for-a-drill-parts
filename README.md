## Overall  
Its a good idea to use the principle of "putting it in the hole" - its better than my idea of "use as attachments" drill parts, because of less material and easier to make it. Also its a good idea to add a 
drawer for additional parts. I want to think about how to make a acrylic/polycarbonate cap for it: for this moment i dont know how to make it with round angles for better view. I have an idea to use a 3d printed bearing to make a movable holder, but with limitations of time much effective to realize it in next projects in my opinion.
Also: for structural parts i prefer to use a PETg filament (better than PLA because of hydrolytic degradation can break it through 1+ year), holder will be in the box and if it brokes (box) - major to use it by itself. I dont like how to looks plywood but I'll think about how to use it: as a holder (because its faster than i can print it) or for the perimeter of the box

Holes have been added because of less material, weight and some less time of printing, design also. later, during slicing, it became obvious that it made sense only for the sake of design - for example, the time gain was only 4 minutes. The most difficult stages of the simulation were the matching of the parts with each other. the desire to make the box collapsible lost out to my desire to go to bed, so I tried to print the whole box. To adapt to printing, I also modeled drawer guides with theoretically acceptable overhangs for printing

## Problems

There is problem with box:  
![photo_5323817246105135485_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec58a2af-4326-450c-b097-be0891160b96)  



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c6e3d64-1ee0-49c6-86d6-83343827146b


Why did this happen?  

Overhangs? Orcaslicer said about it  
![Screenshot_130](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/977d06d8-5b4d-4f99-8d8c-40fe494e5bf3)  

- No, because we have the same part printed on the other side and we have modified the model to better print overhangs.
  
Cooling?
- No, because not the whole part is in the strings
  
For sure problems in model. We can see this in Orcaslicer
![Screenshot_131](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9adb213-af3d-4811-823e-9eafd7db8a38)

But in Rhino its not easy to see it

## Problem solving  

i thought about different varients to solve this. Major point - try to avoid reprinting the box. For sure if you do this project for the first time you must avoid this problem and use correct model.   

   1. Measurement different thickness of defected wall to find the difference
   ![photo_5326069045918820083_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b0c3357-9dc2-48a1-84e4-43129ce88c72)


By chance, we managed to conduct a test for falling from a height of 1.5 meters onto a tile

   3. Model a path for wall (i will print it if after the drawer test, this will be necessary)

## Modelling drawer  

So many time i've spent to engage the pull-out mechanism...  
It was also important not to increase its thickness excessively in order to save material and save free space. I had to abandon the previous complex rail system and integrate a system consisting of a small touch point in 2 planes on each side, also created cutouts in the box for the protruding parts of the former part of the box. I'll make it easier next time.  The holes are made to reduce printing time, save material and reduce the weight of the box itself in order to reduce the load on the sliding elements of the box and the box itself  

![Screenshot_144](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39be8336-1131-4239-9e23-afd632a234a4)  

Unfortunately, this method led to the appearance of overhanging elements that would require either support during 3D printing and subsequent post-processing, as well as could worsen the sliding of the drawer. I managed to adapt the internal cavities for the rails to 3D printing, there is no upper sliding part, so with a heavy heart I decided to divide the model into 2 parts and glue it later. if it does not withstand the load, I have hope that the box will still function

**Problems**  

PETg comes off the table, despite the fact that I use a lot of glue. I also noticed that the box itself is also deformed at the corners, especially on the side where the printing was unsuccessful due to a defect in the model - I probably should think about uniform cooling during printing or better isolate the printer from ventilation with an open window. But may be this is a reason why it works together (box and drawer) - because both are deformed. So, this is not a bug, but a feature

Creating a path to repair a box  
when I saw that the box was working, I decided that instead of the upper part of the drawer mount, it was worth printing the missing part of the inner wall of the box with a rail  

![Screenshot_150](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0119ae14-2659-402b-9003-a9d5c31e96df)  

but when I loaded the model into the slicer, I saw the overhanging elements and changed it so that it was adapted to 3D printing

## Problems solving  

Let's mark where you need to make a cut

We will glue the part to the box using cyanoacrylate glue  
![photo_5328098448030949687_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eb4f262-ba3a-4cf5-ba75-cc5ad9bcfb66)

it does not look perfect, there is also a gap between the rail at the box itself and the added part, but this does not affect the function. Also, the part will be hidden inside the box and invisible to an outside observer.

## Add additional materials  

Acrylic  

I wanted to make the outer walls of the box out of plywood, but decided that acrylic would look nicer with green PETG. I had the idea to cut out a single piece with live loops, but the question arose as to how accurately the corners would be able to be made. so it was decided to divide into 2 parts and bend.  
Creating in CorelDraw with a helps from one of the teachers from FabLab (Thank you, Alexander!)  

![photo_5328098448030950143_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/630add93-75a2-4488-a6ab-0d14533f9fea)  

Laser cut  



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/872408ff-d58c-42d7-b00e-24e503963cf8  

It was decided to bend the obtained parts from acrylic using a homemade device for bending acrylic, which was in FabLab. By heating the metal thread by convection, the acrylic is heated  

![photo_5328098448030950144_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da95365a-79e9-49f5-abd5-42be7c3a0ee8)  

you should wait until a heating line appears on the top surface of the acrylic, without allowing it to overheat, which will be noticeable by the fact that the part hanging in the air begins to tilt towards the table. then I applied the heated acrylic to the PETg box, carefully bent it and held it for a while to maintain its shape  

![photo_5328098448030950145_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5b5b3b5-c410-4811-9936-7a416677230a)

then remove the film from the inside of the acrylic before gluing the acrylic to the box with cyanoacrylate glue  
![photo_5328098448030950146_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/135b3ad0-ac57-418b-bb3f-17375ea7448a)  

we glue it and look at the result.  

![photo_5328098448030950148_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60b18fb1-24a8-4d9a-a59e-2ede9e85cd9d)  

After this, the PETg box parts can be glued together using cyanoacrylate adhesive. To prevent accidental gluing, I removed the drawer. The protruding parts of the holder itself (the uppermost section), which fit into the lid’s slots like a sieve, were left unglued. This allows time for settling (including shrinkage) and reduces the risk of incorrect positioning. The protective film remains on the outer surface for now.  

![photo_5327836631119554560_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c193d913-f310-4ca6-8cc7-4d9c4acf57e2)  

**Overall**
On the back of the box the acrylic parts could not be connected. Tomorrow I will try to solve this problem. to avoid this in the future, you can not only cut out an acrylic part on a laser machine before bending, but also engrave the line of the future bend for accuracy.  

Initially, I planned to add acrylic, because in the conditions of our task it was strongly recommended to use different materials, but the resulting result not only looks cool, but also gives rigidity to the walls made of PETg, which has elasticity  

## Add a drawer handle with text  

The slot in the drawer was modeled to put a pen with an inscription there. there will also be a qr code with a link to this project so that you can view it from a user who may have problems. the qr will be modeled in CorelDRAW, in Rhino I inserted it for visualization  

![Screenshot_158](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f65e0864-c715-4d34-8a08-751ecdc6a939)  

**Important notes**  

since the task of uploading a qr code for laser cutting may be relevant for other users, I created a separate project and described there in a short form the solution to this problem.  

[Qr-code-for-laser-cut](https://github.com/m2415146/Qr-code-for-laser-cut/tree/main)

## Add plywood  

the way to apply plywood in this project is to make an additional overlay on the top of the holder. a possible additional option would be a greater degree of detail fixation
